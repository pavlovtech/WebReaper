# WebReaper

The domain language of WebReaper — a declarative, parallel web crawler. This file names the concepts a contributor must share to reason about the crawl correctly; it is the reference the architecture review defers to.

## Language

### Crawl topology

**Crawl**:
One end-to-end run of the scraper over a site, seeded from the configured start URLs.
_Avoid_: scrape, scan, session.

**Job**:
A single URL to visit, plus the remaining selector chain and its parent backlinks; the unit the scheduler queues and a worker consumes.
_Avoid_: task, work item, request.

**Selector chain**:
The ordered queue of `LinkPathSelector`s a Job has left to apply before it reaches a target page; its length and its head's pagination flag *are* the crawl state.
_Avoid_: selector list, path, route.

**Page category**:
Which of three roles a Job's page plays — **derived** from the selector chain, never stored on the Job. It is realized as the arm of the **Crawl outcome** the **Crawl step** returns, not as a property of the input (the old `Job.PageCategory` was removed).
_Avoid_: page type (that is the Static/Dynamic load mode — see below), state, kind.

- **Target page**: a Job whose selector chain is empty; its page is parsed with the Schema, yields one ParsedData, and produces no further Jobs.
- **Transit page**: a Job with selectors remaining and no pagination on the head selector; its page yields child Jobs by following the head selector.
- **Page with pagination**: a Job with exactly one selector left that carries a pagination selector; its page yields both item Jobs and next-page Jobs.

### The crawl step

**Crawl step**:
The pure decision that maps a Job, its loaded document, and the config to exactly one crawl outcome. The Spider is the I/O shell around the crawl step, not the crawl step itself.
_Avoid_: spider, handler, processor.

**Crawl outcome**:
The result of a crawl step — a closed sum with exactly three arms: a target page's ParsedData, a transit page's followed Jobs, or a paginated page's item + next-page Jobs. Never more than one arm; not extensible (see `docs/adr/0001-crawl-outcome-closed-sum.md`).
_Avoid_: result, response.

**Advance**:
What a transit page does to the selector chain — consume (dequeue) the head selector, so child Jobs carry the shortened chain.
_Avoid_: descend, pop, next.

**Retain**:
What a page with pagination does — leave the selector chain unchanged, so next-page Jobs re-apply the same step (page 2 of a listing is the same step, not a deeper one).
_Avoid_: repeat, stay, hold.

### Extraction & output

**Schema**:
The declarative field→selector tree describing what to extract from a target page.
_Avoid_: template, mapping, model.

**ParsedData**:
The extracted record from one target page — its URL plus a JSON object.
_Avoid_: result, item, row.

**Sink**:
A destination a ParsedData is emitted to (file, Redis, Cosmos, …).
_Avoid_: output, writer, exporter.

## Relationships

- A **Crawl** processes many **Job**s.
- A **Job** carries a **Selector chain**; the chain's length and head derive the **Page category** (it is not stored on the Job).
- A **Crawl step** maps one **Job** to one **Crawl outcome**.
- A **Target page** outcome produces one **ParsedData**, emitted to every **Sink**.
- A **Transit page** **advance**s the selector chain; a **Page with pagination** **retain**s it.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a page-with-pagination crawl runs, do the item Jobs and the next-page Jobs both keep the same selector chain?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The item Jobs **advance** — the listing selector is consumed, so they're target pages now. The next-page Jobs **retain** the chain, because page 2 of the listing is the same step, not a deeper one."

## Flagged ambiguities

- **Selector-chain handling of pagination vs following was implicit.** In `Spider.CrawlAsync` one call site passed the dequeued chain and another the original chain, with nothing naming the difference. Resolved structurally: the **Crawl step** returns a **Crawl outcome** whose `Followed.Next` and `Paginated.Items` carry the **advance**d chain and whose `Paginated.NextPages` carries the **retain**ed chain — the two rules are now distinct named fields, not two look-alike call sites (see `docs/adr/0001-crawl-outcome-closed-sum.md`).
- **"Page type" vs "page category".** Resolved: **page category** = Target / Transit / Pagination, derived from the selector chain. **PageType** is the load mode (Static vs Dynamic, i.e. HTTP vs Puppeteer). Distinct concepts — never conflate them.
