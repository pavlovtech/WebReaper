# `WebReaper.Cli` browser/stealth acquisition policy: layered auto-spawn, Hybrid C escalation UX, curated backend registry, AOT invariant preserved

## Status

**Proposed** (2026-05-24). Slice 4 of 4 in the **Transports wave** (v11.0.0
target). The CLI's documented browser story. Pins the policy decisions
the rest of the wave (ADR-0052..0054) imply but don't own.

## Context

ADR-0043 established `WebReaper.Cli` as a Native-AOT single binary
published across six RIDs (`linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`,
`osx-arm64`, `win-x64`, `win-arm64`) via `release.yml`. The AOT
constraint is load-bearing: a single self-contained binary the user
downloads from a GitHub release and runs without a .NET runtime install.

Through v10, the CLI's relationship to browser-mode page loading is
implicit: the CLI references core only, and Dynamic page loading throws
the core's `BrowserNotConfiguredPageLoadTransport` error directing users
to add the `WebReaper.Puppeteer` satellite — which an AOT-distributed CLI
cannot bake (PuppeteerSharp is not AOT-clean). The CLI's `--browser` flag
existed at the surface but had no working backing transport.

The Transports wave gives the CLI three new options to choose between
(ADR-0052 `WebReaper.Cdp`, ADR-0053 `WebReaper.Playwright`, ADR-0054
`WebReaper.Stealth.X`). Picking one without a documented policy guarantees
drift; a contributor's next CLI feature would silently bake whichever
satellite was convenient. This ADR pins the picks before drift starts:

1. The CLI bakes **only** `WebReaper.Cdp` for browser support — the
   AOT-clean transport (ADR-0052's bedrock).
2. Browser binaries (vanilla Chromium *and* stealth Chromium forks) are
   acquired through documented CLI subcommands (`browser install`,
   `stealth install`); never bundled.
3. Stealth-backend selection on the CLI surface goes through a curated
   `KnownStealthBackends` static registry — community-contributed
   satellites get CLI integration via a small PR.
4. The user-facing escalation flow (vanilla → stealth) is the Hybrid C
   shape from HITL Round 1: auto-escalate by default with a Y/n prompt;
   power-user `--stealth` flag skips the vanilla attempt; unattended
   `--auto-stealth` / `WEBREAPER_AUTO_STEALTH=1` for CI.

## Decision

### What the CLI bakes

```
WebReaper.Cli
└── PackageReference Include="WebReaper.Cdp"
```

That single browser-related dependency. **`Microsoft.Playwright` is never
baked**; nor is `PuppeteerSharp` (already deleted in ADR-0053); nor is
any `WebReaper.Stealth.X` satellite — those ship for library use only.
The AOT smoke test (`WebReaper.AotSmokeTest`) extends to publish the CLI
binary with `WebReaper.Cdp` linked, asserting zero IL/AOT warnings — a CI
guardrail that fails the build if a contributor adds an AOT-unfriendly
reference to the CLI in a future PR.

### Layered auto-spawn — three rungs

When the CLI needs a browser endpoint (any command path that involves
dynamic page loading), it walks three rungs in order:

1. **BYO** — if `--browser-cdp-url <url>` is passed, the CLI uses it
   directly via `WithCdpPageLoader(url)`. No spawn, no detection. The
   power-user / sidecar / stealth path. The user owns lifecycle.

2. **System detection** — `CdpLaunchHelpers.FindOnPath(...)` searches for
   `google-chrome`, `chromium`, `chrome`, `microsoft-edge`, `msedge` on
   PATH and platform-conventional install locations
   (`/Applications/Google Chrome.app/...`, `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\...`).
   If found, the CLI spawns it with `--remote-debugging-port=0 --headless=new`
   and connects via `WithCdpPageLoader(CdpLaunchOptions)` (ADR-0052's
   launch-and-connect overload). Lifecycle owned by the CLI; teardown on
   process exit.

3. **Managed** — if no system browser is detected, the CLI fails with an
   actionable message pointing at `webreaper browser install`. The user
   runs the install command; subsequent invocations find the managed
   binary in `~/.webreaper/browsers/chromium-<version>/` and treat it as a
   "system" detection (rung 2 succeeds against the cached path).

The order matters: BYO first means stealth scenarios (which always come
in as BYO from `webreaper stealth install` then `--browser-cdp-url`)
take priority over any system browser; system detection second avoids
gratuitous downloads when Chrome is already there; managed last is the
fallback for clean machines (CI, fresh dev box).

### `webreaper browser install` — vanilla Chromium acquisition

```
$ webreaper browser install
ℹ  Downloading Chromium 146 for darwin-arm64 (152 MB) from Microsoft Playwright CDN...
✓  Installed to ~/.webreaper/browsers/chromium-146/
```

**Source: Microsoft's Playwright CDN.** The CDN hosts Chromium builds
under `https://playwright.azureedge.net/builds/chromium/...`,
versioned, signed, with checksums in the release manifest. Used by
`playwright install` worldwide; high availability; ungated by API key.
Mirrors are documented in the CLI's README for users in regions where
the CDN is slow. The alternative (Chromium's own
`commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/` server)
hosts every snapshot ever built — millions of revisions; navigation by
build number is painful for a one-off-install UX. Playwright's CDN is the
curated subset that matters.

**Subcommand surface:**
- `webreaper browser install` — install the latest stable known version
- `webreaper browser install --version 146` — pin
- `webreaper browser list` — show installed cached versions
- `webreaper browser uninstall <version>` — remove a cached version
- `webreaper browser path` — print the cached binary path (for scripting)

### `webreaper stealth install` — stealth-fork acquisition

```
$ webreaper stealth install
ℹ  Available stealth backends (downloaded from upstream; not bundled):
   [1] CloakBrowser   v0.3.30   220 MB   58 fingerprint patches; recommended
       License: https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser/blob/main/BINARY-LICENSE.md
   Choice [1]: ↵

↓  Downloading CloakBrowser v0.3.30 from CloakHQ GitHub releases... ✓
✓  Installed to ~/.webreaper/stealth/cloakbrowser/0.3.30/
```

**The `KnownStealthBackends` registry** is the curated list. AOT-friendly
static data in `WebReaper.Cli/Stealth/KnownStealthBackends.cs`:

```csharp
public static class KnownStealthBackends {
    public static readonly StealthBackend[] All = [
        new("cloakbrowser",
            displayName: "CloakBrowser",
            recommendedVersion: "0.3.30",
            sizeBytes: 220 * 1024 * 1024,
            description: "58 fingerprint patches; recommended",
            licenseUrl: "https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser/blob/main/BINARY-LICENSE.md",
            releaseManifestUrl: "https://api.github.com/repos/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser/releases/...",
            launchSpec: CloakBrowserLaunchSpec.Default),
        // Future: Patchright, Camoufox, … added via PR
    ];
}
```

Adding a backend to the CLI's surface is one PR per backend; the library
satellite ships independently. The registry's job is the *picker UX* and
the *unattended-CI defaults* — not the launch logic (which lives in the
satellite the CLI does not bake; the CLI re-implements a minimal launcher
per registered backend using `CdpLaunchHelpers` directly).

**Subcommand surface:**
- `webreaper stealth install` — interactive picker + Y/n license prompt
- `webreaper stealth install cloakbrowser --yes` — unattended, name-pinned
- `webreaper stealth list` — show installed stealth backends + versions
- `webreaper stealth uninstall cloakbrowser` — remove cached install
- `webreaper stealth path cloakbrowser` — print binary path

### Hybrid C escalation UX — the scrape flow

The `webreaper scrape` command implements the three-rung escalation that
emerged from HITL Round 1:

```
$ webreaper scrape <url> --browser
↓  Spawning managed Chromium...  ✓
⚠  Page returned no records; last response looks like a bot-check (Cloudflare).
?  Download CloakBrowser stealth backend (220 MB) and retry? [Y/n] y
↓  Running 'webreaper stealth install cloakbrowser --yes' inline... ✓
↓  Retrying with CloakBrowser... ✓
✓  Scraped 1247 records
```

**Three modes:**
- **Default (`--browser`):** rung 1-3 escalation. Auto-prompt on detected
  bot-check; user accepts → inline install → retry. Detection is a
  conservative heuristic: HTTP 403/429/503 from the loader OR
  zero-records-extracted on a non-empty page that contains
  Cloudflare/DataDome/PerimeterX challenge markers. False positives are
  cheap (extra prompt, user says no, scrape continues with vanilla).
- **Power-user (`--browser --stealth`):** skip the vanilla attempt, go
  straight to stealth on request 1. Requires the stealth backend
  pre-installed (or the prompt fires immediately).
- **Unattended (`--browser --stealth --auto-stealth` or
  `WEBREAPER_AUTO_STEALTH=1`):** Y/n prompts are bypassed; the CI
  path. Same install + retry flow, no prompts.

### AOT invariant — the guardrail

The wave introduces no AOT-unfriendly dependency to the CLI. Two
CI checks:

1. **`WebReaper.AotSmokeTest` extended.** A new smoke step publishes
   `WebReaper.Cli` with `PublishAot=true` across all six RIDs and
   asserts zero IL/AOT warnings. The existing smoke test publishes a
   library consumer; this one publishes the actual CLI as a binary. Run
   per PR; a regression that pulls Microsoft.Playwright or
   PuppeteerSharp into the CLI graph fails the build immediately.
2. **The CLI's `.csproj` is the gate.** Reviewers see additions to
   `<PackageReference>` in PRs touching `WebReaper.Cli/*.csproj` and can
   block additions of AOT-hostile satellites. The pattern is the same as
   `WebReaper`'s own `.csproj` — `WarningsAsErrors=CS1591` (ADR-0023)
   applied to AOT warnings via the smoke test.

The invariant is also written down in this ADR (the part of the ADR
discipline that future contributors actually grep for): *the CLI bakes
only `WebReaper.Cdp` for browser support. Adding Microsoft.Playwright or
any `WebReaper.Stealth.X` satellite to the CLI's references regresses
the AOT guarantee and must be rejected; the install-from-upstream
pattern is the alternative.*

## Considered options

- **Layered auto-spawn + Hybrid C + curated registry, AOT preserved
  (chosen).** Convergent answer from the HITL forks: F3 picked layered
  auto-spawn, F4 picked per-backend satellites, the stealth-UX redesign
  picked Hybrid C, F8 folded the registry into this ADR. The shape is
  the resolution of those forks.
- **Pure BYO — CLI requires `--browser-cdp-url` always (rejected).** Was
  one of three F3 options. Cleanest possible CLI; biggest friction. The
  casual user with Chrome installed has to know the CDP launch incantation
  before they can scrape a JS-rendered page. Killed the casual scenario.
- **Auto-spawn only — CLI always finds-or-downloads its own Chromium, no
  BYO path (rejected).** Forecloses pointing at a stealth Chromium fork
  from the CLI surface. Forecloses CI scenarios where the user runs a
  proxied browser farm. F3-rejected on convergent reasons.
- **Two CLI binaries: AOT (no browser) + JIT (with Playwright)
  (rejected).** Doubles RID count to 12; sheds ADR-0043's single-binary
  guarantee; bifurcates the user-install story. F3-rejected.
- **Hardcoded list with no registry abstraction (effectively chosen, but
  the *registry abstraction* itself was reconsidered).** The
  `KnownStealthBackends` static array is the simplest "registry" the
  AOT-CLI can carry. F8 considered a dynamic manifest convention
  (`~/.webreaper/stealth-backends/*.json` scanned at runtime) but the
  AOT constraint plus NuGet's lack of post-install hooks killed
  dynamic discovery; the curated list is the working answer.
- **`webreaper stealth install` auto-running on first `--browser`
  bot-check detection without prompt (rejected).** Implicit 220 MB
  download is intrusive; Hybrid C's Y/n prompt was explicitly chosen for
  the user-consent surface. `--auto-stealth` is the explicit opt-out for
  unattended use; the default stays prompting.

## Accepted cost

- **Community stealth-backend integration with CLI requires a PR.** The
  satellite ships freely on NuGet; CLI's `KnownStealthBackends` entry +
  the minimal launcher need a small PR. Trade for the curated-quality
  bar (no surprise stealth backends in the CLI's `--stealth` picker)
  and the AOT-safe static registry shape.
- **The CLI re-implements minimal launcher logic per backend.** Because
  the CLI can't reference `WebReaper.Stealth.X` (AOT), each entry in
  `KnownStealthBackends` carries the fork-specific launch flags + binary
  layout the CLI needs. Duplication with the satellite; cheap to keep in
  sync (one tested place + one tested place is still better than one
  AOT-hostile dependency).
- **Bot-check heuristic for auto-escalation has false positives.** The
  HTTP-status + page-content-marker detector misfires on legitimately
  empty pages and on sites that return 403 for non-bot reasons. False
  positives surface as an extra prompt the user dismisses with `n`; the
  scrape continues. Documented in `--help`; tunable via
  `--no-auto-stealth` to disable the heuristic entirely.
- **Subcommand surface grows from one verb (`scrape`) to four (`scrape`,
  `map`, `init`, `browser`, `stealth`).** Already five with ADR-0043's
  `init`. This ADR adds two more verb roots. The CLI's surface area is
  still small (< 20 leaf subcommands); growth is on-pattern.

## Deliberate consequences

- **The CLI gets a coherent browser story end-to-end.** A new user
  installs the CLI, runs `webreaper scrape <url>`, hits the
  Cloudflare-blocked tracker, prompts to download CloakBrowser, runs it,
  ships data to MongoDB — all WebReaper-native, no Python, no manual
  sidecar. The audiobook scenario from HITL Round 1 walks end-to-end.
- **AOT-as-policy, not aspiration.** The CLI's AOT publishability is a
  smoke-tested CI invariant; ADR-0009's "AOT-clean is a core guarantee"
  extends concretely to the CLI surface. Future "let's bake Playwright
  into the CLI" proposals have this ADR to push back against.
- **Stealth-backend installer is a documented capability surface.**
  Future captcha-solver wave (deferred from F5) can layer onto the same
  install pattern (`webreaper captcha install <service>`); the precedent
  this ADR sets is the template.

## SemVer

**Minor (additive).** New CLI subcommands; no break to existing surface.
`webreaper scrape ... --browser` *behaviour* changes (previously threw,
now works via the auto-spawn path) — that's a bug-fix-shaped behaviour
delta, not a contract break. v11.0.0's major is owned by ADR-0053.

## v2 deferrals (named so they don't drift into v11)

- **Captcha-solver install pattern** (`webreaper captcha install`) — F5
  from Round 1, deferred to v12+.
- **Library-level transport escalation** (`TransportRouter`, the
  proposer-validator dock applied to transports) — F7 from Round 1,
  deferred to v12 pending demand.
- **CLI auto-update for cached browser/stealth binaries** — a separate UX
  question (background updater? manual? periodic check?); not in v11.
- **Mirror-CDN config for `webreaper browser install`** beyond the
  README documentation — first-class CLI flag (`--cdn-base-url`)
  deferred until users in restricted regions report blocking.
- **Multi-platform CloakBrowser RID coverage** — depends on what
  CloakBrowser publishes. v11 satellite covers the RIDs the upstream
  ships; gaps documented in the satellite README.
